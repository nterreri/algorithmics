This package contains the definition of two Graph ADTs, with a single concrete
implementation for both. The purpose of this package is to implement a weighted 
directional graph that provides an interface for three core capabilities:
1. Calculate the length of a given route between vertices in the graph
2. Calculate the number of possible routes between two vertices of the graph 
(given some condition that limits the amount of loops allowed if the graph is
cyclical)
3. Calculate the length of the shortest route between two vertices

In order to run the demo file (DirectedWeightedGraphDemoJUnit.java) it is 
necessary to have a platform from which to run JUnit tests over Java classes.
One way to do this is to download a distribution of eclipse that supports Java 
(see https://eclipse.org/downloads/), import the package into an eclipse workspace 
(see http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/) and run the 
demo file. There should be distributions of eclipse available for most OS's 
(including Windows and Mac), eclipse distributions that support Java programming
should automatically support JUnit as a testing framework.

A more comprehensive set of tests than the demo, which tests the rest of the
implementation, can be found in another JUnit test case file: 
DirectedWeightedGraphUnitT.Java

A separate repository has also been created for ease of access:
